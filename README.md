This repository contains code developed as part of my Geophysics MSci Master's project exploring the limitations of full-waveform inversion due to elastic effects. Specifically, this code can be used to model reflection coefficients, conduct monte carlo simulations of reflection coefficients, and convert them into finite frequency synthetic seismograms for a simple two layer model. For a theoretical description of the problem, and a demo of the code, please see the following Jupyter Notebook:
